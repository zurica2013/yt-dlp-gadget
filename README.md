# yt-dlp-gadget
A simple tool batch file to run yt-dlp

## Tips
- Replace "cd C:\%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\youtube-dl" with your own storage path to yt-dlp.exe in Windows OS, or just delete it if you've set the relevant environment variable.
- The file should be saved as ANSI encoding rather than UTF-8, and don't miss out the ANSI escape codes marked as  in the source file.
